						<a><u>Process Time(s):</u></a>
						<ul>	
							<li><a class="bold">The brewing process takes around 4 ½ hours for 7 steps </a> (depending on the recipe and how soon the recipe is selected): Please keep in mind large groups will extened the time.</li>
									<br>
							<li><a class="bold">Recipe Creation</a> (~15 – 30 minutes which also includes time for our staff to weigh the grain out) : Choosing what beer style you would like to brew/make.</li>
								<br>
							<li><a class="bold">Milling </a>(5 mins): crunching the grain to break open the epidermis to access the inner and outer endosperm.</li>
								<br>
							<li><a class="bold">Mashing</a> (~1 ½ hours includes time to reach recipe temp): Activates the malt enzymes and converts the grain starches into fermentable sugars. recipes with more natural grains make require a longer mash time.</li>
								<br>
							<li><a class="bold">Sparging</a> (~25 mins):  Rinsing of the mash grain bed to extract as much of the sugars from the grain as possible.</li>
								<br>
							<li><a class="bold">Boiling</a> (~1 ½ hours including time to reach boiling temp): This step may take longer for the larger volume (50l).</li>
								<br>
								<ul><i>
									<li>The Boiling Process does the following:
										<ul>
											<li>Inactivation of residual enzymes from the mash.</li>
											<li>Isomerization of bittering hop α-acids.</li>
											<li>Sterilization of the wort.</li>
											<li>Removal of unwanted volatiles.</li>
											<li>Precipitation of unwanted proteins as “hot break” (trub).</li>
											<li>The concentration of the wort.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul></i>
								<br>
							<li><a class="bold">Casting</a> (~25-35 mins): Moving the wort from the kettle into a fermenter using a pump and heat exchanger to cool the wort down to a temperature that the yeast can tolerate without dying.</li>
								<br>
							<li><a class="bold">Pitching the yeast</a> (~1-3 mins): Pour the yeast into the fermenter to start the fermentation process.</li>
								<br>
							<li class="bold">The brewing process is over!</li>
								<br>
							<li style="color:#bc0606;"><a class="bold">Note:</a> book your dry hopping (if required for that recipe) and bottling appointment(s) before you leave. this does mean you will need to make multiple trips to tcob. please keep that in mind if you want extra flavors or an ipa that requires dry hopping.</li>
								<br>
								<br>
							<li class="bold"><u>What is next:</u></li>
								<br>
							<li><a class="bold">Fermentation</a> (~3 to 6 weeks): Your beer will ferment for a given amount of time (depending on the style of beer and the yeast used), this is generally between 3 to 6 weeks.</li>
								<br>
							<li><a class="bold">Dry Hopping</a> (~15-25 min): If your beer requires dry hopping (adding additional flavorings like hops or fruit purees, etc.)</li>
								<br>
							<li><a class="bold">Bottling</a> (or kegging): After the fermentation process is complete, come in to bottle your beer at your scheduled bottling appointment. bottling is a 2-hour process.</li>
								<br>
						</ul>


						<a class="bold">Questions:</a> Do i have to bottle my beer? <br>
							<br>
						<a class="bold">Answer:</a> No. we offer kegging (co2 or n2) your beer. we do not supply or sell kegs. we do not rent kegs. we can keg your beer into a corny keg or sanke (d-coupler) keg. there is a $15 keg washing fee.  you can also place the beer into growlers, but we do not recommend it as it has a very high probability of oxidizing and losing carbonation.<br>
